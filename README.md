# Arcanum-Spell-Description
This project will bring more details and nerd data to how the spell works  
After nice development of previous mod  
https://github.com/SCARaw/Arcanum-Item-Description-Project  
This mod will take a look at spells descriptions in Arcanum  
However majority of spells are described more or less correctly, some of them have misleading wording or lack of data  
This time major goal will be to bring up this details missing, damage range, healing range, increase resistance by how much?  
so instead of having the players quesing, you can be sure what spell will do
